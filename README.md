![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef99ebc-cdc3-451e-b6cf-5a1077d8e990)
<br>

2. Go to virtual network and add custom DNS.<br>
Here we are adding private IP address of Domain controller VM on VNET DNS server settings. So that, all the servers in that VNETS knows about DNS server.<br>
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce381d05-a5c1-46ab-82e2-591137c75088)

**Deploy Domain controller then add Domain and users on DC server.**<br>
1. Now login into Domain controller VM which we have created previously and install AD DS role on it.<br>
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2a51ca9-29ec-4800-b95c-db6000a45fb0)
2. Then promote this server as domain controller. While promoting server as Domain controller, enter your domain name by selecting option Add a new forest.<br>
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dd6327e-1d4d-4518-a548-9e8fc1e9aa53)
